# kobo-notes-to-readwise
My first project, where I aim to solve a simple problem of sending Kobo book highlights and notes to Readwise, which is a great app for reviewing highlights from many sources.
Readwise in turn export all notes to Notion, which is the most enjoyable notetaking app that I have used ;)
